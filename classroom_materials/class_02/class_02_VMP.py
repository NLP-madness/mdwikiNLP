This script contain an example Text class

Each function contains:
An explanation as well as an example
Your job as a studygroup is to make the functions in class 2 and 3.

In class 3 we will then assemble a pipeline using the Text class at the end.


I suggest you start from the top and for each function:
    1) discuss potential solution (e.g. sentence segmentation splitting by ".")
    2) implement the simplest solution first for each function
    3) go back and improve upon the initial function

for class 2 it would be ideal if you have a simple version of the following
functions:
    sentence_segment
    tokenize
    n_grams
    ner_regex

Additional stuff which you might add is:
    A function for dependency parsing using stanza
    alternatives to each of the function (e.g. using tokenization using nltk)
    Add a function for stemming
    Add plotting functionality for word frequencies
    Add plotting functionality for dependency trees

would like it to be otherwise, or se he says.
This sentence tests (or intends to) test parenthes
and exclamations! At least that was the plan.
Another thing one might do is the following: testing this.
Abbreviations like are tricky. Does this come to mind?
I thought so. The little Martin Jr. thought it was good."""
