"""
This script contain an example Text class

Each function contains:
An explanation as well as an example
Your job as a studygroup is to make the functions in class 2 and 3.

In class 3 we will then assemble a pipeline using the Text class at the end.


I suggest you start from the top and for each function:
    1) discuss potential solution (e.g. sentence segmentation splitting by ".")
    2) implement the simplest solution first for each function
    3) go back and improve upon the initial function

for class 2 it would be ideal if you have a simple version of the following
functions:
    sentence_segment
    tokenize
    ner_regex

Additional stuff which you might add is:
    A function for dependency parsing using stanza
    alternatives to each of the function (e.g. using tokenization using nltk)
    Add a function for stemming
    Add plotting functionality for word frequencies
    Add plotting functionality for dependency trees

def sentence_segment(txt):
    """
    txt (str): Text which you want to be segmented into sentences.

    hint: look up the re.split() function in the re module and 
    and .split() method for strings.

    Example:
    >>> txt = "NLP is very cool. It is also useful"
    >>> sentence_segment(txt)
    ["NLP is very cool", "It is also useful"]

    Example:

    creates n-grams from a given tokenlist

    Example:

    sentence_list (list): a list of sentences

    Named entity recognition using regular expressions.

    alternative options:could also be a list of tokens and/or the raw text.
    This will result in how you can you can use it later on, but for now
    let's not dwell too much on this.

    hint: look into the re package/module

    Example:
